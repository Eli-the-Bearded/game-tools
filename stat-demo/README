Here is a recorded session with `stat-timer` showing how it is meant to
be used for periodic updates. This is a level 56 character fighting in
"The Graveyard" in Andor's Trail. I add updates with taking health
potions ("bonemeal") or between waves of zombies when I can check my
inventory for gold.

FINAL

In about 15 minutes (959 seconds):
xp             +12,215 change;    45,854.01 p/hour;  12.74 p/s
bonemeal           -11 change;        41.29 p/hour;   0.01 p/s
gold               +81 change;       304.07 p/hour;   0.08 p/s

Continue where you left off with
  ../stat-timer 52797xp 196bonemeal 28476gold
```

Compare the graveyard "final" numbers to what I was doing at level 34
against "gournauds", where I was using no healing potions but not
tracking gold. Some output from earilier versions of stat-timer:
