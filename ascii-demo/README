```
perl ../asciimapper --demo demo-map.art
```

That creates the ascii art map `demo-map.art`, a key file for the map
`demo-map.key`, then runs the `asciimapper` tool over those to create
the IFM fle `demo-map.ifm`.

Next, after you have compiled and instaled `ifm` (compilation worked fine
for me on Ubuntu 18, but was not going well on NetBSD 8).

```
ifm --map -f ps -o demo-map.ps demo-map.ifm
```

to create a postscript map, `demo-map.ps`. I've converted that to 
`demo-map.png` for ease of viewing.
